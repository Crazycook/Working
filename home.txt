Most of his colleagues are unaware of Nick's true identity as a vampire. Only his friend, city medical examiner Natalie Lambert, knows about Nick's identity as a vampire. One advantage to having a vampire working on the police force is the ability for Nick to use his superhuman characteristics, including enhanced senses and mind control, to help him bring criminals to justice. Nick's quest for redemption becomes more complicated when fellow vampires arrive in Toronto and throw obstacles in front of him as he strives to reach his ultimate goal -- becoming human once again.

In 2149, overdeveloped and polluted Earth is dying. With no way to reverse the damage done to the planet, a group of scientists finds a way to open a fracture in the space-time continuum. This creates a portal to prehistoric Earth, leading to a last-ditch effort to save the human race by correcting mistakes of the past. The Shannon family participates in the 10th pilgrimage to Terra Nova, facing such prehistoric dangers as dinosaurs. The Shannons are also challenged within Terra Nova, as not everyone on the mission has the same intentions to save mankind. Prolific filmmaker Steven Spielberg serves as an executive producer of the series.
